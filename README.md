# Sparkify-Automated-Data-Pipelines
Creating automated data pipelines for a company - Sparkify that enhances automation and monitoring in their data warehouse ETL pipelines


## Project Description
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow. In this project, I will build highgrade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. I will also ensure there is data quality and run tests against the datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.
